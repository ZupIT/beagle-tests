Feature: ListView Component Validation
    As a Beagle developer/user
    I'd like to make sure my listView component works as expected


    Background:
        Given that I'm on the listView page

    Scenario: ListView 01 - whole page validation
        Then the current page screenshot should be identical to image "ListViewWholePage"

    # depends on https://github.com/ZupIT/beagle-web-angular/issues/280
    # Scenario: ListView 02 - characters listview 1 scroll validation
    #     When I scroll the listview with id "charactersList" to the end
    #     Then the current page screenshot should be identical to image "ListViewCharacters1Scrolled"

    Scenario: ListView 03 - characters listview 2 validation
        When I click on a button with exact text "next"
        Then the current page screenshot should be identical to image "ListViewCharacters2"

    # depends on https://github.com/ZupIT/beagle-web-angular/issues/280
    # Scenario: ListView 04 - characters listview 2 scroll validation
    #     When I scroll the listview with id "charactersList" to the end
    #     Then the current page screenshot should be identical to image "ListViewCharacters2Scrolled"

    Scenario: ListView 05 - infinite scroll listview
        When I scroll to the bottom of the infinite scroll listview
        Then the current page screenshot should be identical to image "ListViewInfiniteScroll"
